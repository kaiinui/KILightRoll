Background

* It's needless to ask "photoroll or take a picture?"
* It's too heavy to open full modal to choose a picture.
* It's too heavy to take a picture in full screen.

SO?

* Put "take a picture" and photoroll in one. (the first object is take a picture, and others are photoroll.)
* Acts like SlidingUpPanel.
* Take a picture in inline. (incam)
